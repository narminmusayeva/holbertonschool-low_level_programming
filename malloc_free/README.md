Malloc and Free Directory
This directory contains implementations and tests related to dynamic memory allocation in C using the malloc and free functions.

Files
malloc.c: A custom implementation of memory allocation using malloc.
free.c: A custom implementation of memory deallocation using free.
tests/: A folder containing test cases to check the correctness of memory allocation and deallocation.
Overview
The malloc function is used to allocate memory dynamically during program execution, while free is used to deallocate that memory once it is no longer needed. In this directory, we explore both concepts, implementing them from scratch and validating their behavior through a series of tests.
